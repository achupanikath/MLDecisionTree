We faced a considerable amount of issues in logically wrapping our head around the concept. Due to time constraints, even though we believe we understood how to implement it we could not troubleshoot one conceptual error that kept prompting an error in the infogain.

The way we implemented this is using an arbitrary depth and infogain value as the metrics by which we determine when to stop building the tree. This was tested conceptually and in a small scale and seems to work. However, when we ran the dataset in this, we faced an error where random instances of a subtree produced no infogain. We think we can get around this by debugging extensively to see which specific issue is causing this but we genuinely could not dedicate more time than we did owing to senior design project commitment and general last week of classes project overload. 

Given that classify was dependent on learn_tree we wrote the pseudo code of the process that would successfully build classify the tree but we were not able to test it and so did not turn in the said code. 

We do think that on looking at the helper functions and the general functioning of the solution that we implemented, it does demonstrate that we genuinely attempted to understand and program the solution but failed to do so at a conceptual level owing largely to time constraints rather than dedication constraints.
